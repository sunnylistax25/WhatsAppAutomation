# WhatsAppAutomation
#This project is build to solve a personal problem of no updating WhatsApp Status on the right time of my friends birthdays as well as specific occasions. As a Data Scientist, I realize that if I am unable to analyze and find a solution to my own problems how can I build proper models for the future.
# The project will be using Python, Selenium and Beautifulsoup.
# The project is with the intention to solve the issue of forgetting your close one's birthday especially when the number of friends you have is countless.
# Through this project my main goal is to understand and go deep with automation using beautifulsoup and Selenium. 
# Using WhatsApp web, the model will be able to sign in to my personal account.
